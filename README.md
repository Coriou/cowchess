# CowChess

A fun-killing way to play daily chess games on chess.com

### How ?

- `yarn start`
- Type your chess.com username
- Beat everyone

### Why ?

I recently got pulled into playing chess.com daily games. Hadn’t played chess in years, and never online. Despite an outdated interface, I was amazed by the depth of chess.com, all the tools and especially the analysis of games. Wanted to see how that worked and discovered the world of chess engines. I knew nothing about board state representation (called `fen`) nor anything else about digital chess.

Got really fascinated and wanted to build something. A little CLI app that finds the best moves for my current games seemed like a good and easy enough idea.

### What ?

### Dat name ?

Based on the name of the place where people I play with & I work. Also reminded me of the word « coward » which seemed like a good fit for such a program

### Next ?

Whatever.
