# CowChess

A fun-killing way to play daily chess games on chess.com

### How ?

- Open `./src/utils.js`
- In the `updateGames()` method, put your / a chess.com username
- `yarn start`
- Beat all your friends until they figure out you’re cheating and you’ll like an idiot

### Why ?

I recently got pulled into playing chess.com daily games. Hadn’t played chess in year, and never online. Dispite an outdate interface, I was amazed by the depth of chess.com, all the tools and especially the analys of games. Wanted to see how that worked and discovered the world of chess engines. I knew nothing about board state representation (called `fen`) nor anything else about digital chess.

Got really fascinated and wanted to build something. A little CLI app that finds the best moves for my current games seemed like a good and easy enough idea.

### Dat name ?

Based on the name of the place people I play with & I work. Also reminded me of « coward » which seemed like a good fit for such a program


### Next ?

Whatever.
